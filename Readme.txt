There are 2 folders - Source and Target folders.
Source folder will contain files (city names and id) that are pushed to this folder at specific interval.
WeatherNews service will generate output in Target folder (will have date in its name) which will contain weather data for cities 
extracted from Source files.
Source and Target folders can be configured in App.config file.
Example source files are added in Solution Items folder
